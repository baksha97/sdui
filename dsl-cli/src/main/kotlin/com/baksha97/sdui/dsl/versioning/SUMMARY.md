# Semantic Versioning System: Summary

## Overview

This implementation provides a simple yet flexible semantic versioning system for the SDUI project, replacing the previous integer-based versioning approach.

## Key Components

1. **SemanticVersion**: A data class representing versions in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
2. **VersionRegistry**: A central registry for managing versions across the project
3. **SemanticVersionManager**: A manager for handling version compatibility and migration
4. **TokenAdapter**: An adapter for bridging between existing Token classes and the new versioning system

## Improvements Over Previous Approach

The previous versioning system had several limitations:

1. **Limited expressiveness**: Integer-based versioning (1, 2, 3) didn't provide context about the nature of changes
2. **No centralized version management**: Versions were defined in individual token classes
3. **Manual migration code**: Required separate migration methods for each token type
4. **Tight coupling**: Versioning was tightly coupled with token implementation
5. **Limited flexibility**: Difficult to define custom migration paths

The new semantic versioning system addresses these limitations:

1. **More expressive versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format clearly indicates breaking changes, new features, and bug fixes
2. **Centralized version management**: VersionRegistry provides a single source of truth for all component versions
3. **Flexible migration**: Custom migration paths can be defined for specific version transitions
4. **Loose coupling**: Versioning is separated from token implementation through interfaces and adapters
5. **Backward compatibility**: Works with existing Token classes through the TokenAdapter

## Benefits

1. **Better communication**: Semantic versioning communicates the nature of changes to developers
2. **Simplified migration**: Centralized migration paths make it easier to handle version transitions
3. **Improved maintainability**: Separation of concerns makes the code more maintainable
4. **Enhanced flexibility**: Custom migration paths allow for complex migration scenarios
5. **Backward compatibility**: Works with existing code through adapters

## Usage

The system is designed to be easy to use:

1. **For new code**: Implement the VersionedToken interface in your token classes
2. **For existing code**: Use the TokenAdapter to convert between Token and VersionedToken
3. **For version management**: Use the VersionRegistry to register and track component versions
4. **For migration**: Use the SemanticVersionManager to migrate tokens between versions

## Example

```kotlin
// Set up the version registry
val registry = VersionRegistry()
val versionManager = SemanticVersionManager(registry)

// Register component versions
registry.registerVersion("TextToken", "1.0.0")

// Create a token
val token = TextToken(id = "text1", version = 1, text = TemplateString("Hello"))

// Convert to a versioned token
val versionedToken = TokenAdapter.toVersionedToken(token)

// Migrate to a new version
val migratedToken = versionManager.migrateToken(
    versionedToken,
    SemanticVersion(1, 1, 0)
)

// Convert back to a regular token
val updatedToken = TokenAdapter.fromVersionedToken(migratedToken!!)
```

## Conclusion

The semantic versioning system provides a simple yet powerful way to manage versions in the SDUI project. It improves upon the previous approach by adding more expressiveness, flexibility, and maintainability, while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
